## Github Rules

1. Never change otherâ€™s working file or folder(may cause serious conflict)
2. All code reviews will take place on pull request
3. Branch names don't matter but make sure they are meaningful
  > ex) /dev/test/createAttack
4. After merging the branch, the branch has to be deleted for clean branch tree
5. Commit comments have to contain developer's name
  > ex) Ben <comments here>
6. Make sure git pull origin master before you start to work on the local project
7. If you want to make any changes on the directory or files which are not in your working directory, always let others know and discuss it through. Otherwise the change will be dismissed.
8. Nothing
